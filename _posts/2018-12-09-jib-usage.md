:sailboat: Build container images for your Java applications.

## What is Jib?

Jib builds Docker and [OCI](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) images for your Java applications. It is available as plugins for [Maven](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-maven-plugin) and [Gradle](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-gradle-plugin) and as a Java library.

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/): See documentation for [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-maven-plugin).
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/): See documentation for [jib-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-gradle-plugin).
[Jib Core](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-core): A general-purpose container-building library for Java.

## Goals

- **Fast** - Deploy your changes fast. Jib separates your application into multiple layers, splitting dependencies from classes. Now you don’t have to wait for Docker to rebuild your entire Java application - just deploy the layers that changed.
- **Reproducible** - Rebuilding your container image with the same contents always generates the same image. Never trigger an unnecessary update again.
- **Daemonless** - Reduce your CLI dependencies. Build your Docker image from within Maven or Gradle and push to any registry of your choice. *No more writing Dockerfiles and calling docker build/push.*

## Quickstart

### Maven

See documentation for using [jib-maven-plugin](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-maven-plugin#quickstart).

### Gradle

See documentation for using [jib-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-gradle-plugin#quickstart).

### Jib Core

See documentation for using [Jib Core](https://github.com/SongYintao/jib/blob/master/jib-core#adding-jib-core-to-your-build)

## How Jib Works

Whereas traditionally a Java application is built as a single image layer with the application JAR, Jib's build strategy separates the Java application into multiple layers for more granular incremental builds. When you change your code, only your changes are rebuilt, not your entire application. These layers, by default, are layered on top of a [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/distroless) base image.
